Description
-----------
taichow keyboard for romanized goetian T'e-ciu-'wa
These is a Keyboard for Church Romanization of Ningpo,Soochow, and Taichow.
According with the wenchow romanization, I add the tonemarks function on this keyboard for representing tones of Goetian.
I believe this keyboard can be used as a effective tool of digitalization communication in Goetian.
Of course you can use it to transcript Bible.
This Keyboard was developed based on Keyman. I have also developped a Android version app for users, based on Keyboard App Builder of SIL language.
