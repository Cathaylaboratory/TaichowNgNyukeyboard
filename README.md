taichow keyboard for romanized goetian T'e-ciu-'wa
Hello everybody.
Here is the Taichow keyboard for romanized goetian or Wu language. I believe this keyboard is the very first keyboard which can type romanized goetian or Wu.
The source of this romanization is the church romanization of Taichow, Soochow, and Ningpo dialect.
I added additional tone marks feature on this keyboard. The rising sound is using R to type, the falling sound is using X to type.
This keyboard is based on keyman, which is a free keyboard app. You can download it on app store or on their homepage.
Please download the install package then install it on your laptop or your phone.
You can use this keyboard to communicate with your friends who speak Wu and use it to digitalize documents.
